<h1>Rules for our Slack channel</h1>

<p>As with any of our conference spaces (online or physical), participants are
expected to follow our <a href="{% url 'coc' %}">code of conduct</a>.</p>

<p>In order to make the experience pleasant for everyone, we also ask that you follow some slack-specific rules:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Do not message people privately without their consent, and do not invite them
to join any room without their consent.</li>
    <li>Do not mention people who don't belong to particular room in that room.</li>
    <li>Do not post advertizing or job postings outside of the dedicated #jobs channel.</li>
</ol>

<p>
If at any time you're feeling uncomfortable due to anyone's behaviour on the Slack
channel, please contact the organizers by emailing <a href="mailto:coc@djangounderthehood.com">coc@djangounderthehood.com</a>,
approaching them at the conference, or using the emergency phone numbers listed in the <a href="{% url 'coc' %}">Code of Conduct</a>.
</p>

<p>
When possible, include screenshots or chat logs of any unwanted messages.
</p>

    Tickets!
</h2>

<p>The tickets for the conference will be available for sale on Tuesday, 16th September at 17:00 (5pm) CET which is 15:00 (3pm) UTC. Each ticket
will cost 125â‚¬ (EUR) and VAT is not applicable. Number of seats is very limited (less than 100) so we expect to sell out quickly. </p>

<p><b>Refund policy:</b> We can accept ticket cancellations up to two weeks before the event. If you want to cancel after that, we will refund only if we find a new buyer for your ticket. </p>

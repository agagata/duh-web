# We need your help✋

> Published on 7th Jun 2016 by Agata Grdal

We are seeking companies who wish to support Django Under the Hood financially.

---

As organizers, we are focused on making this event the best place to share knowledge and build a community around Django.

We want to gather Django core team members and Django developers to teach us all about Django. We want to welcome the most diverse group of people possible. And we want to make the event as affordable and accessible as possible for everyone.

We know those are ambitious goals. In order to achieve them, we need your support.

You can find our sponsorship brochure here: <a href="http://tinyurl.com/duth2016-sponsorship">http://tinyurl.com/duth2016-sponsorship</a>, but we’re also open to new ideas.

If you are interested in collaborating with us, please <a href="mailto:hello@djangounderthehood.com">get in touch</a>!

# We need your help ✋

> Published on 7th Jun 2016 by Agata Grdal

We are seeking companies who wish to support Django: Under the Hood financially.

---

As organizers, we are focused on making this event the best place to share knowledge and build a community around Django. 

Django: Under The Hood aims to gather Django core team members and Django developers to explore in-depths of Django and help shape the future of Django together. Every year thus far, we were able bring more than 20 members of the Django core team to the event. We also aim to welcome the most diverse group of people possible, that's why we're funding tickets and travel in [our Scholarship program](/scholarship/). On top of that, we strive to make the event as affordable and accessible as possible for everyone.

These are all ambitious goals. This year again we're hoping to meet with 300 passionate Djangonauts and share knowledge together. In order to make that happen, **we need your support**.

[See the sponsorship brochure we prepared](http://tinyurl.com/duth2016-sponsorship), or chat to us! We’re open to any and all of your ideas.

If you are interested in collaborating with us, please [get in touch](mailto:hello@djangounderthehood.com)!

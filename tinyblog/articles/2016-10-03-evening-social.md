**Getting there:**  
To get to Pllek, take a ferry to NDSM. Ferry 905 to NDSM leaves from behind Central Station, and departs every 30 minutes, at :15 and :45. Between 17:00 and 18:30 it leaves every 15 minutes. Ensure you take the right ferry, as they leave for other destinations too. The last ferry towards NDSM leaves Central Station at 23:45. From the ferry port, you can [walk to Pllek](https://www.google.nl/maps/dir/Amsterdam,+Veer+NDSM+Werf,+Amsterdam/Pllek,+Amsterdam/) in a few minutes.

The trip to NDSM takes about 15 minutes and has nice views - as you get close to NDSM you'll be able to see the former Amsterdam shipbuilding yard, Pllek itself on the side of the water, a hotel on a boat and a defunct Soviet submarine. There are some restaurants on the NDSM side, including [IJkantine](http://www.ijkantine.nl/en/home-2/) and [Loetje aan 't IJ](http://loetjeaantij.loetje.com).

Another option is to take ferry 903 from Westerdoksdijk, but this is harder to reach by transit. Note that NDSM may not be the first stop of this ferry. There are also buses going to NDSM.

To get back, you can take 906 ferry to Centraal Station at :00 and :30. The last ferry on this line leaves at 23:30, but there is a night ferry. Night ferry 904 leaves NDSM at 00:04, 00:49, 01:34 and a few later times. Ferry 904 goes to Westerdoksdijk and then Central Station, so make sure you get off at the right port.

We can't wait to see you there!

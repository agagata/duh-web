Welcome to tinyblog, the only blog engine in the world that's both
under and over engineered.

To publish an article on tinyblog, create a markdown file (with .md extension)
in this directory and voila, it will be published on the index page and will
have a dedicated URL as well.

The name of the markdown file will be the post's slug used in the URL (with the
markdown extension removed).

On the index page, posts are sorted in reverse alphabetical order, so you can
use a date prefix to the file in order for posts to appear chronologically (latest first).


Enjoy! âœ¨

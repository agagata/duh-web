# 2016 Registration

> Published on 1st Jul 2016 by Ola Sitarska

Every year tickets to Django: Under The Hood are selling out in a matter of minutes.
This year we're trying something different to make the distribution of tickets
a little bit more fair and less frustrating for everyone.

Read on to learn about the important changes we're making this year!

---

#### The Short Version

1. __On Tuesday, July 12, we're going to open registration.__
You'll have two weeks to submit your e-mail address for the lottery, until July 19th at noon CET.

2. __On Thursday July 21st at noon CET, we're going to randomly select attendees 
who will receive a link to purchase their conference tickets.__ This link will be
valid for 72 hours, and then we will randomly assign it to another attendee until
all of the tickets have been purchased.

That's it! ✨

#### Pricing

For 2016, the full conference passes including 1.5 day of Talks and 1.5 of 
Sprints will have the following pricing:

- 200€ for individual attendees (paying out of their own pocket) 
- 300€ for corporate tickets (companies buying tickets for their employees)

We're following DjangoCon's pricing structure to keep event as affordable 
for everyone as possible.

#### The Slightly Longer Version

Django: Under The Hood started as this little thing for around 100 people who joined
us in Amsterdam for the first time about 2.5 years ago. We had no idea if this 
would work, but your excitement and care never ceased to surprise us.

The 100 tickets for our very first edition were gone in just few minutes. On our second year,
we welcomed 3 times as many people, yet the "sold out" banner showed up on our
tickets page just 10 minutes after registration was open.

The 300 is a number that we're capping the conference at. A sweet spot for serendipity, 
while still making it possible to organize with our small volunteer team. 

But one thing we didn’t like about the registration process in the last two years: the 
feeling of panic and chaos that came from that confusion, and the subsequent mad rush
to be first in line to buy a ticket. The process also didn't allow many people 
who were traveling, working, or sleeping at the time when our registration was open 
to attend the conference. 

This is not the experience we want to provide to you, hence this year we're giving
you more time to purchase a ticket on your own terms.

#### Feedback? Questions?

We'd love to chat! If you've got any feedback on how we could further enhance
the registration process, or have any question about the process this year, we'd love
to hear from you.

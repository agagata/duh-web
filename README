Django: Onder de Motorkap
=========================

This is the project for the http://djangoonderdemotorkap.nl/ website.


Deploying the old website
-------------------------

Say you need to deploy a new commit to the old website 2014.djangounderthehood.com.

Assuming:

* You have push access to the app on Heroku
* Your heroku git remote for the app is called `heroku-2014`

Here's what you do:

* Do your commit in the branch `oldsites/2014`
* `git push heroku-2014 oldsites/2014:master`
* ???
* Profit.

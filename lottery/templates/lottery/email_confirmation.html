    This is a confirmation that your email has been added to 2016 Django: Under
    the Hood ticket lottery. ðŸŽŸðŸŽ²

<p>
    <strong>What happens now?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Sit back and relax! â›±

    We will start inviting the first batch on Thursday July 28th at noon CET,
    and successive batches in the days or weeks after.

    Note that if you are invited, you have 72 hours to actually confirm and 
    pay for your ticket, or it will be assigned to someone else.
